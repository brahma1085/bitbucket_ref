					Enterprise Resource Information System is generally any kind of
					computing system that is of &quot;enterprise class&quot;. This
					means typically offering high quality of service, dealing with
					large volumes of data and capable of supporting some large
					organization (&quot;an enterprise&quot;). <br> <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprise Information
					Systems provide a technology platform that enables organizations to
					integrate and coordinate their business processes. They provide a
					single system that is central to the organization and ensure that
					information can be shared across all functional levels and
					management hierarchies. Enterprise systems are invaluable in
					eliminating the problem of information fragmentation caused by
					multiple information systems in an organization, by creating a
					standard data structure. <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A typical Enterprise Information System would be
					housed in one or more data centers, run enterprise software, and
					could include applications that typically cross organizational
					borders such as content management systems. <br> <br>

					resume from the net, as well as easy to search for the job in
					various companies which are providing the vacancies and the user
					can also specify his skills set along with his resumes. This
					information will be carried to recruiter to maintain the details of
					different applicants to search for the vacancies. The marketer
					motivates the applicants for applying for the job in the
					organization. He enters the details of the new applicants. He can
					see the details of the existing applicants and search the
					applicants by their Id, skills, etc.,. He can also put the
					attachment of resume. All this information is used by the recruiter
					to conduct the test and arrange for the interviews of the selected
					applicants . The recruiter uses the information entered by the
					applicant in the database to conduct the test to the applicants and
					arrange for the interviews to the candidates passing the test. He
					recruits the candidates passing the interview as employees in the
					organization. He assigns id and other related attributes to them.
					Administrator takes care of the job orders and the client
					information. He is going to do the placement i.e., assigns the
