	The Employee's Provident fund is managed by an organisation called the
	Employee's Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which is one of the
	largest provident fund institutions in the world in terms of volume of
	transactions. The organisation came into being in 1952, following the
	Employee's Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act (EPF & MP
	Act), 1952. All workers whose emoluments exceed Rs.6,500 per month have
	an option to join the scheme with the consent of the employer. The
	employee is eligible for membership of EPF from the day he joins such a
	company which is covered under the EPF and MP Act, 1952. The rate of
	contribution payable by the member is fixed at 12% of his emoluments -
	basic pay, DA, cash value of food concession and retaining allowance up
	to a maximum of Rs.6,500 per month. Voluntary higher contributions are
	also acceptable at the joint request of the member and the employer.
	But this application designed for the easy calculation of EPF based on
	the employee PF percentage and default percentage is taken as 8.5% &
	Its developed with basic level of Enterprise standards in-consideration
	with time.
